1. Can I use any package to identify, median the upper/lower extremes, quatiles etc of my dataset?
1. What are the alternatives to box plots? Beanplots, histograms, ggplots, beaswarm, density plot


To run the Notebook, you must have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. You can install this using the [Anacona](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python Distribution. You can also view the Notebook in a static format using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

The notebook itself is called `Box Plots- An Investigation.ipynb`.
